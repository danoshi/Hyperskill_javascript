<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Developers quite often make bad decisions about where and in what form they will store data. A bad decision can cause harm to a company if it does not think about the reliable storage of information. For new companies, the amount of data about their customers in the future is not known, so they can store data in a local file on the computer. Become the savior of such a company and try to process the available data in the <em>database.csv</em> file to make it more business-friendly.</p><p>In the first stage, think about how to start working with the <em>database.csv</em> file and what data structure to choose for storing information about users.</p><p>If you open the <em>database.csv</em> file, for example, in your IDE, then the first lines will look like the screenshot below. This file has four columns: <code class="java">id</code>, <code class="java">nickname</code>, <code class="java">password</code>, the consent to mailing. The last column may contain information on whether the user agrees to receive emails from the company. Each line of this file is an individual user. As you can see, some data may be missing; for example, the user with <code class="java">id = 2</code> has <code class="java">-</code> instead of a nickname, which means that the nickname is lost.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="plain text user data csv" height="363" src="https://ucarecdn.com/5a73555f-5c4b-4dcd-a3b3-79018b5cf8aa/" width="457"/></p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Your program must be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Store the data from the <em>database.csv</em> file in the data structure of the programming language you use;</p></li><li><p>The output of your program should look like this: <code class="java">The user &lt;name of last user&gt; has "&lt;consest to mailing of last user&gt;" consent status for sending emails</code></p></li></ul><p><code class="java">&lt;name of last user&gt;</code> is the user nickname from the last line of the <em>database.csv</em> file, <code class="java">&lt;consest to mailing of last user&gt;</code> is the consent to mailing of the same user, the last one in the file.</p><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>the last line contains information 24, Myjljczgg, g12q67lp, yes</em></p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">The user Myjljczgg has "yes" consent status for sending emails
