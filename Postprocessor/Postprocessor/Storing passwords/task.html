<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>In this stage, think about the security of your data. In real life, user information may leak, so you must minimize the potential losses when data is leaked.</p><p>If you do not store personal information, then the most valuable data is passwords, because people do not like to come up with complicated and unique passwords every time. Often the same password is used for all services, including banking, which is very dangerous for a person. This is why you need to convert the password strings in your <em>database.csv</em> file and hash them. Hash files cannot be decoded using the secret key, which means that even the company does not know the customer passwords, which also increases data security.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><ul><li><p>Your program must hash each user's password using the <strong>SHA-256 hash function</strong> for data from the <em>database.csv</em> file;</p></li><li><p>Write the resulting data with the converted password to the <em>hash_database.csv</em> file created for you. This file contains only one line  <code class="java">id, nickname, password, consent to mailing</code>.</p></li></ul><p>Do not output anything to the console. The tests check only the <em>hash_database.csv</em> file.</p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>example of the hash_database.csv file with single user information</em></p><p><img alt="SHA-256 hashed password" height="66" src="https://ucarecdn.com/4eb8a079-e328-4ed8-9a26-7a8807de904c/" width="866"/></p>
